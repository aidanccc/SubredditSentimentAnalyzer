How to smooth things over with my manager?,"My colleague resigned and I had to take all his work given a very tight deadline, at the same time I wasn't very familiar of his job. I was working 12 hours a day on weekdays and also worked a bit on weekends to get everything done. Most of things (95%) were done before the deadline except because I was too busy, I missed two things, and one coworker who helped out a little bit did one thing wrong.

  
But when the boss explained to his boss and also in the debrief meeting, it became that I made three mistakes. Although my boss didn't blame me too much, he said these three mistakes don't wash out the efforts I put in. But I still felt uncomfortable because I only made two mistakes.

  
What is worse is that my line manager, who is the reviewer of the whole task. The first thing my boss did was to message me in private to tell me don't be sad and encourage me. But the first thing my line manager did was to read through all the chat history in Teams, looking for evidence that it was not her fault. My boss and I ended up having to calm her down and to make her happy, while I took all the responsibilities. After this, my line manager asked another manager to review all the documentations I prepared for the task, so she doesn't need to look at it.

  
The atmosphere between my manager and I is also very weird these days. No matter how much I tried to be friendly, she seemed cold and not want to work with me. I feel I should not have helped out from the beginning. I did all the work and the team was not happy and now the relationship between my manager and I is tense.

  
I really liked my manager before as she was very friendly and often praised me, but now those are all gone.",smooth things manager colleague resigned take work given tight deadline time wasnt familiar job working hours day weekdays also worked bit weekends get everything done things done deadline except busy missed two things one coworker helped little bit one thing wrong boss explained boss also debrief meeting became made three mistakes although boss didnt blame much said three mistakes dont wash efforts put still felt uncomfortable made two mistakes worse line manager reviewer whole task first thing boss message private tell dont sad encourage first thing line manager read chat history teams looking evidence fault boss ended calm make happy took responsibilities line manager asked another manager review documentations prepared task doesnt need look atmosphere manager also weird days matter much tried friendly seemed cold want work feel helped beginning work team happy relationship manager tense really liked manager friendly often praised gone,"{'neg': 0.166, 'neu': 0.66, 'pos': 0.174, 'compound': 0.314}",0.314

I don't know how to start my career.,"
Hello everyone, first of all, I am from México so sorry if there are any grammar mistakes. Also, long post. 

I am 24 years old, I graduated back in july 2024 as a Veterinarian and Animal Scientist (Médico Veterinario Zootecnista), and started a Job in a clinic in October of that same year, to be honest I dont like working in clinic or dealing with owners in that way, I was mostly happy because I could do some lab work like stool tests, blood smear, urianalysis, cytology, blood work, but I was not comfortable when it came to diagnostics and surgery.

This month I was fired due to me speaking against the way another vet treated the dogs and cats when the owner wasn't around and how the clinic cared more about money than the Health of the Pets.

I am ok with being fired, I have no debt, I have some savings that can last me until May 2026 covering house expenses, food, services, and even eating out or buying things for myself, and I still live with my parents.

Here comes the first dilemma, I have already paid full for a music festival in february, entry tickets, a 5 night Stay in a hotel, vehicle, and have money separated for food and souvenirs. My plan was to use my PTO for those days and get back to work after that, but since I got fired, entering another job right now would only last for a month and a half since in México (I don't know if it works like this in other countries) you need a full year of work before having the right to ask for PTO. I know I can work again for some time in another clinic but again, It is not my cup of tea. And not going to the festival is not an option because I dont want to waste everything that has already been paid for.


With that said, I am more interested in biostatistics, epidemiology, public health (mostly) and laboratory work. And I am already enrolled in some courses (Advanced Excel, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics in Public Health)

I know the situation in México is not the same as those in another countries, but I am seeking a general overview because I don't know what to do next, and I am kinda scared about my future, I am scared a would not find an entry and get stuck. 

What can I do to enter the field(s) I want to go to without burning bridges because of the music festival? 

Has anyone had a similar experience? 

Do you have any job recommendations in the meanwhile or how to starr? 

I have the opportunity to get a specialization in public health starting in august and it is a 2 year course with the possibility of having a scholarship that could pay me more than what I was receiving in my first Job. Is it worth it? I have read that having that kind of degree is not worth it unless you already have experience. 

I am sorry if the answer is straight-forward but I cant see it right now, honestly I am scared of dissapointing my parents and I dont want to be a lazy son during this time.

Thank you for your time and your answers.

"How to recover from crappy job history, USA?","Hello, I'm ftm(23) with crappy work history. For example my longest job within the last three years is 2-3months. My longest job to date in general is a year and that was back in 2019 to 2020, I was also in high school. Almost all my jobs have ended with me walking out or quitting without a two weeks notice. The only job where I didn't quit was when I was laid off from the covid-19 outbreak. I didn't go back because I had acquired a new job by the time they called me back. The reason for me quitting often had to do with not getting along with people, overstimulated, and or mental breakdown. I am finally medicated properly and wanting to start making a career for myself but dont know where to start. Most of my experience is in some form of retail with a mix of warehouse/manufacturing experience. Is there any job recommendations someone can give as well as advice? I have adhd, anxiety and bpd. I also have depression but that doesnt affect my work as much as the other three.

How do I fit in at work?,"For context, I've been job shadowing a part-time role in graphic design for a month and I'm about to sign the contract soon. I'm basically working as a normal employee and I get to be around other employees on a daily basis. 

Now, everything seems to be going well, except for one thing: I'm hardly talking with anyone on the team. It's not like I don't have the courage to adress them but our conversations don't go beyond logistics. I attempted to ask some of my coworkers about their day in an attempt at small talk but with no success because I always get the same answer, that they've been working. I confess that I'm socially awkward and shy and I've been used to people trying harder to interact with me, mostly because at college people seem more eager to talk with anyone when they don't have acquaintances around. However, because friendships bonds are already formed at my job, I see that this isn't an issue. 

My coworkers seem to have their own friend group and are super close. Most of their conversations contain either inside jokes or closed interests. I don't know how can I join or get close to anyone. I feel like crap most of the time because I'm excluded but at the same time I don't want to be invasive.

"Perspective on degrees, experience, and how employers actually evaluate people","Hey everyone,

I want to share a perspective and invite discussion, not start an argument. I am not downplaying education or university in any way. I genuinely respect anyone who committed to earning a degree. That takes discipline, time, and effort, and it deserves respect.

My confusion comes from how experience like mine is often treated as if it has no value at all.

I worked in a structured corporate environment at Ford for almost five years, including a team leader role with real standards, processes, and accountability. After that, I spent close to two years building and operating my own service based marketplace business. I managed contractors, handled hiring and firing, owned pricing, margins, CAC decisions, onboarding processes, and daily operations. I also recently launched a second version of the business in the U.S., so I have gone through early stage setup more than once. I hold a Six Sigma White Belt certificate as well, which reflects exposure to structured process improvement and operational thinking.

What I struggle to understand is why this is often dismissed outright, especially online, while a degree is treated as the only valid signal of competence for operations or management roles. In many business and operations jobs, most learning seems to happen on the job anyway. Many friends with degrees have told me their actual work looks nothing like what they studied, and they were trained internally after being hired. From the outside, it feels like the degree mainly signals that someone showed up consistently, followed structure, and completed a long term commitment, which I agree is valuable.

That is where I feel frustrated. I showed up to a demanding job for years, then showed up again to build something from scratch with real financial and personal risk. I learned by doing, by making mistakes, and by being accountable for outcomes. Yet a lot of people with degrees do not seem to respect or even acknowledge that effort at all. I fully respect their path, but that respect often does not feel mutual.

I am not saying degrees are useless. I am also not talking about regulated or highly technical fields like engineering, medicine, or nursing, where formal education is clearly essential. I am talking specifically about business, operations, and management roles.

I am curious how founders, hiring managers, and early startup employees see this in practice. How do you personally weigh formal education versus hands on operator experience. Do you think experience like this is equivalent, weaker, or stronger in certain roles. Has your view changed over time as AI and on the job training have become more common.

I am offering this perspective in good faith and genuinely interested in discussion from people who have built, hired, or managed teams.",perspective degrees experience employers actually evaluate people hey everyone want share perspective invite discussion start argument downplaying education university way genuinely respect anyone committed earning degree takes discipline time effort deserves respect confusion comes experience like mine often treated value worked structured corporate environment ford almost five years including team leader role real standards processes accountability spent close two years building operating service based marketplace business managed contractors handled hiring firing owned pricing margins cac decisions onboarding processes daily operations also recently launched second version business us gone early stage setup hold six sigma white belt certificate well reflects exposure structured process improvement operational thinking struggle understand often dismissed outright especially online degree treated valid signal competence operations management roles many business operations jobs learning seems happen job anyway many friends degrees told actual work looks nothing like studied trained internally hired outside feels like degree mainly signals someone showed consistently followed structure completed long term commitment agree valuable feel frustrated showed demanding job years showed build something scratch real financial personal risk learned making mistakes accountable outcomes yet lot people degrees seem respect even acknowledge effort fully respect path respect often feel mutual saying degrees useless also talking regulated highly technical fields like engineering medicine nursing formal education clearly essential talking specifically business operations management roles curious founders hiring managers early startup employees see practice personally weigh formal education versus hands operator experience think experience like equivalent weaker stronger certain roles view changed time ai job training become common offering perspective good faith genuinely interested discussion people built hired managed teams,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.693, 'pos': 0.229, 'compound': 0.9915}",0.9915

My manager is leaving next week and I’m the ONLY other person in the department. Complete radio silence from leadership. Advice?,"I’m in a bit of a panic and need some outside perspective.
I work in a two-person department: just me and my manager. My manager put in their notice and their last day is next Friday. The problem is, it’s been a week since the announcement and I have heard zero from upper management or HR about what the plan is.
No one has reached out to discuss:
• Who I’ll be reporting to starting Monday.
• How my manager’s workload (approvals, high-level projects, etc.) will be handled.
• If they are even looking for a replacement.
I’m currently terrified that on Monday morning, I’m just going to inherit an entire department’s worth of work with no pay increase, no title change, and no support. I’m already at capacity with my own role, and my manager handled a lot of specialized tasks that I haven’t been fully trained on yet.

• Should I wait for them to come to me, or should I be the one to demand a meeting?
• How do I professionally say “I can’t do two jobs for one salary” without sounding like I’m not a team player?
• Is this a “run for the hills” red flag, or an opportunity to ask for a promotion?
Any advice on how to handle the next 5 days before I’m left totally solo would be greatly appreciated.

Am I making a mistake leaving my current job?,"I am about to leave my current job for a new job. Its mostly because my company was acquired last year, and the merging process has finally begun. They laid off a good chunk of people (including some of my direct team members) a couple months ago. For the past few months, we have been just working on documentation and support work instead of building new features (I am a software engineer).

In a meeting a month ago, one of the higher ups mentioned that the parent company will be looking at this documentation early next year and trying to see what they can swap out with their stuff to remove redundancy, which I assume will lead to more layoffs (less code to manage probably means less needed people).

I started interviewing over the past few months and got some job offers. I turned down the first few because they didn't seem much more stable than my current situation (early-stage startups, private equity owned with bad Glassdoor reviews, etc.).   
  
I finally got a job offer that seemed a bit more stable (Series D unicorn startup, millions of users, deals with large companies and multiple state governments, 25k pay bump). It would require me moving to another city by May (Houston -> Austin). Main red flag was that they had had a layoff of 40 people a year ago (450 total employees, so about 8%).

I'm mostly concerned by the fact that even though its a Series D unicorn, its still a startup that had significant layoffs that happened a year ago. I've only been at my current job for a year and want my next job to be something I can stay at for at least a few years. They said they had a 'healthy runway' and 700% growth over the past few years with plans for more in 2026, but I'm not sure if the layoffs are a deeper sign of potential trouble on the horizon that could lead to yet another unstable situation.

Should I go for the new job, or stay and keep applying and hope that I can find an offer with a normal, profitable company (isn't a startup / owned by private equity) before something happens? I did have a few interviews with 'normal' companies but haven't been able to pass the technical interviews yet.",making mistake leaving current job leave current job new job mostly company acquired last year merging process finally begun laid good chunk people including direct team members couple months ago past months working documentation support work instead building new features software engineer meeting month ago one higher ups mentioned parent company looking documentation early next year trying see swap stuff remove redundancy assume lead layoffs less code manage probably means less needed people started interviewing past months got job offers turned first didnt seem much stable current situation earlystage startups private equity owned bad glassdoor reviews etc finally got job offer seemed bit stable series unicorn startup millions users deals large companies multiple state governments k pay bump would require moving another city may houston austin main red flag layoff people year ago total employees im mostly concerned fact even though series unicorn still startup significant layoffs happened year ago ive current job year want next job something stay least years said healthy runway growth past years plans im sure layoffs deeper sign potential trouble horizon could lead yet another unstable situation go new job stay keep applying hope find offer normal profitable company isnt startup owned private equity something happens interviews normal companies havent able pass technical interviews yet,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.6832}",0.6832
Look for a critique of my cover letter,"I decieded to ditch the standard templates I see online and make my cover letter not only more personal, but similar to how I tell stories in my creatve writing projects. I am welcome to any feedback. This for a communications intern postion at a nonprofit org.

Here is what I have  so far: 

  
Dear Hiring Manager,

Every day, millions of stories live quietly online. Many of them never reach the people who could help. {Insert Company Name} exists to change this. As one of the most trusted crowd sourcing platforms, {Insert Company Nmae} has helped millions of people pay their medical expenses, education costs, and emergency situations.I am interested in the communications intern position because I want to be a part of a team that supports communities during everyday moments and times of crisis.

During moments of urgency, establishing trust is everything. While interning for { insert lobbying firm} in Washington, D.C., I focused on healthcare issues that affected people long before they became headlines. This included advocating for the firefighters and first responders exposed to PFAS. The individuals who had put their lives on the line to contain the LA fires earlier this year were now facing long-term risks. Timing mattered. Accuracy mattered. Communicating the right information to the right people was essential in ensuring that their concerns were taken seriously by Congress and not overlooked. 

While supporting this work, we noticed a gap in how critical information was being tracked. There was no centralized system that showed which Senate candidates were running for reelection in 2026 and how this would impact support for the firm's healthcare legislation. It became my job to create a master document that could be continuously updated as the political landscape shifted on Capitol Hill. This allowed our team to adjust our messaging, policy briefs, and client communications as funding priorities and timelines changed. And more importantly, it helped ensure that grassroots organizations and the media could get this issue out to the congress people most likely to hear the message

I see this internship as an opportunity to deepen my skills in public relations and written communication. {Insert Company Name} focus on storytelling, media engagement, and supporting local communities aligns with both my past work and the direction I hope to  takein the future as a communications professional.I look forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with your team in more detail.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

  
Sincerely,

New HR job and job description doesn’t match actual work?,"I recently began working as an HR Administrator in October, and it’s not turning out how I thought it would. 

I was at my previous position as a Purchasing planner then Operations Admin for 8yrs in a manufacturing facility until I was restructured out in September. This new position matched almost exactly what I was doing but with an HR title - interviewing, onboarding, attendance and discipline tracking, HRIS input, and minima payroll. 

When I came in they said the hours were flexible and I can come in when I want and work 8hrs, take lunch if I wanted, and have my own space. I’d occasionally assist with answering reception calls and ordering office supplies. 

Well when I came in, it turned into me prepping for plant tours, answering the door the first half of my morning, ordering lunches everyday, I had 2 mos to plan an entire Christmas party for 200 people, ordering all office supplies and stocking fridges, orchestrating 5 luncheons across 5 shifts, ordering and dispersing all 200 Christmas gifts, payroll, onboarding, attendance, and helping implement a new HRIS system I’ve never worked with (when I was hired I was a novice with their current system). 

I’m working 6 days a week so I can stay on top of my work, which I’m not maintaining. My boss helps when I ask but told me party planning and helping with ordering supplies “isn’t really his forte”. He does the tiny tasks I can knock out easily if I wasn’t bombarded at the door all day. I’m expected to stay from 730a-7p to assist with night shift people unexpectedly because my boss is still there and asks me to. I was packing up to leave last night and he then tasked me with looking through a huge box of papers from last August to find a document without saying please or thank you.

I was expecting computer work and actually HR tasks, and I’m now the office mom. I can’t say no without risk of losing my job I feel like. The money is good, 65k salary, but it feels sexist to expect a woman to be a receptionist, event planner, and HR at the same time.

2 people have helped me with planning throughout, but they’re the Accountants and work hybrid most days. It’s not right to pin them with additional work IMO, but I appreciate nonetheless. It really should be my boss helping.

At this point, should I just start looking for something else? Am I being a baby about the workload?

Query on providing notice,"So, first off, this is for a family friend who's about my age and has been recently asking my advice on something.

Family friend in question works for a company, and has done for around a year and three months, maybe. Enjoys the job, but says it's not what they want to do forever. Since then, they have had some productive conversations with another company off of their own back (initiating it, speaking with them, everything), which has resulted in them receiving a job offer.

Said family friend is over the moon obviously, but has now reached another concern where they don't know when to move on providing notice. From what they've said, their line manager is in only one day in the coming week and they're keen to outline the situation and get moving ASAP. However, they're also worried that it would look bad to do it before christmas, particularly given that they would effectively be just not going back as their leave is about to reset and would cover the full notice period.

I have argued it would be better to tell the company now and get it formalised, but they're a bit nervous.

Any advice I can go back to them with in order to help them moving forward?

ive recently moved to the city from the countryside. i was searching for a job for like 3(?) months.
found one in a grocery store-its about assembling orders that people make online. this is my first job,keep that in mind.
when i read in the description ""12 hour shifts"" i thought almost nothing of it,i mean i am a strong woman yk.
started working. my legs hurt horribly(!!) every single day. to the point i couldn't stand. that is my first issue.
the second one- the ""treatment""(?). one of the upper ups told me to search for every singe item myself( things people order) and not label things as ""gone"" when they are not to be found. 
then, the boss sat me down on day two and explained to me that i am too slow. how can a new person be fast? i barely know where to find the items people order. it takes me time. + i can barely walk. the upper ups do not understand me at all, even when i tried to explain.
the third issue- the man in the store. there is a man working in a different sector who is too friendly. i dont want to get much into this, but it has escalated to the point i dont go to the bathroom if i see him near.

so all of that combined has lead me to go home in a hysterical breakdown every single night. i am aware this job is not for me. earlier today i had my first panic attack of my life and it was all due to the job. + i have weird little bumps on my hands that my parents think is an allergic reaction- all started when i got the job. (i dont have any allergies) 
me and my boyfriend have decided i should quit and  search for a new job after only working there for a week. my best friend agrees. however, everyone at the job, my so called colleagues, say i will get used to it all. 

your thoughts on this situation?

"Is it considered ""cheating"" (or just smart) to use AI to auto-rewrite my resume keywords for every single application?","I have been applying for jobs for months, and the standard advice is always to tailor your CV to the Job Description. Honestly, I do not have the mental energy to manually rewrite my resume for Thirty different companies a day. I was sending generic versions and getting rejected constantly, likely by the ATS filters because I was missing specific keywords.

So, I set up a personal workflow using AI that takes a Job Description, extracts the hard requirements, and automatically rewrites my bullet points to align with that specific advertisement. Since I started doing this, I have noticed I am getting past the initial screens much more often. But, I feel a bit like I am gaming the system.

My question is whether recruiters frown upon this if they find out.

I disagree with how people go about job hunting,"Maybe I will get flamed for this or maybe someone takes the advice. Either way I figured I would share what actually worked for me.

I was twenty seven making around ninety thousand a year including overtime. I was averaging sixty five to seventy hours a week. I had a degree in basically basket weaving and solid soft skills from my career.

I decided to job hop into a management role in a different industry making eighty thousand a year but only working forty hours a week. I absolutely hated every second of every day in that role.

So what did I do. I opened LinkedIn at work and started to realize that getting a good job or career is heavily driven by networking. If someone introduces you to the hiring manager or can vouch for you it adds a lot of weight.

I spent about four months on LinkedIn cold messaging people in the industry I wanted to break into. I asked if they had ten to fifteen minutes to chat about making the jump into that field. Before reaching out I always looked for something in common like where they lived or a shared background to help build rapport.

That process got me multiple high level interviews for roles where automated screening would have filtered me out immediately. Many times I was technically disqualified but a connection was able to get me an interview anyway.

Eventually this led to landing a role making one hundred fifty thousand a year, fully remote, and something I genuinely love. It took longer than just applying online, but now that I am in tech it is very clear to me that networking is the best path forward.

That is also why I keep growing my network and try to help others when I can.

"Junior 3D/Virtual Production – feeling lost, need guidance","Hi everyone, I could really use some advice and support regarding my future.  
Sorry if this post feels a bit messy – it’s exactly how my head feels right now, and I need to get it out. Thanks for your patience.

A bit about me:  
I’m 34 and currently in my third year studying Immersive Media Production in Ireland. I’m a career switcher — before this, I worked in journalism for over 10 years, but I’ve had to change both my country and my career path.

I’ve always dreamed of working with video games, but during my studies I’ve found myself more drawn to Virtual Production. Over the past few years, I’ve explored everything and, honestly, ended up learning bits of everything but nothing fully. I love it all – I’ve done modeling, environment creation, texturing in both Substance Painter and Designer. I quickly realized that Houdini and character sculpting aren’t for me… at least, not right now.

Currently, I’m tackling Emiel Sleegers’ course Creating Destroyed Assets for Games, which is tough.

Back to my question: I constantly hear that junior 3D jobs are rare, competition is fierce, AI is taking over, etc., and it’s starting to drain my motivation and energy to keep going (sorry, I know how that sounds).

My ideal job (at least as I see it now) would be creating virtual worlds for films, commercials, or games — essentially, working as an environment artist in Unreal Engine. But I don’t know the next step. According to my plan, I should be working within 6–10 months, and right now, it feels almost impossible.

I have strong soft skills and a decent foundation in these areas, but I honestly have no idea where to focus next.

Thanks so much for reading this far. Please feel free to be honest — I want to hear all your thoughts, opinions, and advice.

Thanks again.",junior dvirtual production feeling lost need guidance hi everyone could really use advice support regarding future sorry post feels bit messy exactly head feels right need get thanks patience bit im currently third year studying immersive media production ireland im career switcher worked journalism years ive change country career path ive always dreamed working video games studies ive found drawn virtual production past years ive explored everything honestly ended learning bits everything nothing fully love ive done modeling environment creation texturing substance painter designer quickly realized houdini character sculpting arent least right currently im tackling emiel sleegers course creating destroyed assets games tough back question constantly hear junior jobs rare competition fierce ai taking etc starting drain motivation energy keep going sorry know sounds ideal job least see would creating virtual worlds films commercials games essentially working environment artist unreal engine dont know next step according plan working within months right feels almost impossible strong soft skills decent foundation areas honestly idea focus next thanks much reading far please feel free honest want hear thoughts opinions advice thanks,"{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.703, 'pos': 0.224, 'compound': 0.9831}",0.9831
Should I be worried about my job saftey?,"I work as a CNA at a Rehabilitation facility and I’ve been working there since late September for one 12-hr shift a week but since winter break started I’ve picked up an extra shift. This is my first job ever and so I’m not the best employee but I wouldn’t say I’m the worst.

Today the nursing supervisor called me and said they were overbooked today so the director of nursing at our facility canceled my shift. This would be the first Sunday I don’t work since I got here and while they called me early enough I was to tired to have a conversation I’ve been thinking about it and it seems suspicious.

I usually only work weekends/Sunday as they have trouble filling those spots so for them to be overbooked seems sus but not impossible, but why would the Nursing director personally cancel my shift?? This type of stuff seems below her pay grade. Lastly while writing this I remembered that last Thursday I missed my schedule “education blitz” program that we were apparently supposed to do. I signed up for a spot but I forgot to put it in my calendar so I didn’t show up. 

All this summed up and my general newness to my job and inexperienced in the job field makes me worried about my position. Is this a sign to start looking for a new job or should I buckle down and wait til Tuesday (my next scheduled shift). Would calling back when the day shift supervisor comes and asking about my job stability be a good idea??

Manager taking too long to provide me a company car,"Hi

I have been working for this company for 2 years. And been in sales for 1 year. I first asked my manager for a company car back in April. He would brush it off and not really say yes or no. The reason i started to ask was because i was buying my first house and i have a car on finance which could limit the amount i could borrow. I would make a point to ask once a week and his responses would always be like ‘you know the company take £300 off your wages’ or ‘the branch is skint’ and even sometimes flat out said ‘no’ . 

My mortgage advisor got back to me to say i’d be able to afford my car payments as well as my mortgage so the lender didn’t mind. However my new house is further from my family home i moved out of. It’s costing me a lot in petrol and i could get an electric car which would be a lot less (£200p/m with insurance/tax/servicing all paid for). I then started to look for electric cars that i could buy as my manager kept saying no. I guess he saw how stressed it was making me and said ‘we can look at a company car for you’. Guys i was so happy when he said this back in september. It’s now december and everytime i ask it’s back to ‘i’ve not asked about it yet’.  And just multiple excuses. I’m actually getting really drained. 

I don’t want to take it higher because he is a really nice manager but i don’t know why he’s dismissing it so much when it would really help with my financial situation. And i have a lot of renovating to do in my new house and that extra £3/400 p/m would be so so helpful. 

in my contract it says I am entitled to a company car however I’ll have a £2000 salary decrease which I am fine with. 

What would you do? I don’t want to create any bad blood between me and him as we really get a long but it’s clearly not a priority to him even thought it would massively help me out. 

Also he chooses the car and i feel like if i go higher up then he will give me something terrible.

People gettin promoted over me and tons of contradictions? Don't know how to proceed,"Pretty much, this is my second job at a retail space, but I still take the job ""seriously"", this spans situation spans over a year. So our work ended up being understaffed. My manager would make jokes, constantly would give me tons of compliments about my work and reliability, and ask me if I'd want to be promoted to a position, and one of the days, she said yes. She said that she would ""start the process"" and talk with upstairs to get it going. A few weeks pass and I follow up and she then says that ""It's not needed, we should be fine"", in which I assumed someone was hired with more qualifications (Ive been working here for a year, but I have background and work experience at other jobs). 

Ends up that person leaves after a month, and then following months, 3 new people were hired. Prior to them being hired, I was told that ""if your performance didn't improve, I would have to cut your hours"", in which was odd because just a week before we had performance reviews and there was nothing but high positives that were given. These 3 new people who I had to work under, after talking with them, all of them had 0 experience in the position, and very very lackluster work experience in general (less then 2 years in any job combined). One of them it was their first actual job, and they were rather nervous because they have never done stuff like this and were inexperienced (their words).

I practically informally trained them, and handled everything at my work, they practically did absolutely nothing but close the registers, while I helped customers, do sales, cleaned, and put up merchandise, and even delegate the people these people when I worked with them, despite them being ""above"" me. Even THEM asking me why I wasn't in their position, and I just ended up telling them ""I didn't want to"" to make them not lose their confidence. I assumed it would get better, but I ended up just making them reliant on me to do everything, and after putting up with this for nearly half a year, I talked to my manager about their performance and how I end up doing all the work and responsibilities this entire time, and how confused I was. My manager ended up, after our talk telling me she had no other option and that she had to ""hire whoever applied"" and that they applied for my position (the lower one) and my manager practically gave them the position. She also ended up saying that I'm genuinely one of the best employees, adding even more confusion to me.

Fast forward more months, every new employee either asks me, treats me, or thinks that I'm the higher position, while nothing changes. But later, the assistant manager comes up to me to ask if I was interested in the position, as there was another need for it, and I said I was, and she told me, that the manager said to her that ""I want him to show ownership"". Which felt like an utter slap in the face because a year ago she asked me and I explicitly said I would like to do the position, and she acknowledged it, seemed like proceeding with it, and just totally brushing it off.

Now, present time, after I went to, and told my manager again that I would be open to taking on the position, in the following weeks I learn that another worker who started way after I did is getting promoted instead, and that worker even asked about why Im not getting the promotion, because she also has been a supporter of my work, but she was told by manager that ""he really didn't want that position"". 

I am utterly confused what the in the world is going on here? I feel like Im in bizarro land. What do I do? Thoughts? Im SO lost.",people gettin promoted tons contradictions dont know proceed pretty much second job retail space still take job seriously spans situation spans year work ended understaffed manager would make jokes constantly would give tons compliments work reliability ask id want promoted position one days said yes said would start process talk upstairs get going weeks pass follow says needed fine assumed someone hired qualifications ive working year background work experience jobs ends person leaves month following months new people hired prior hired told performance didnt improve would cut hours odd week performance reviews nothing high positives given new people work talking experience position lackluster work experience general less years job combined one first actual job rather nervous never done stuff like inexperienced words practically informally trained handled everything work practically absolutely nothing close registers helped customers sales cleaned put merchandise even delegate people people worked despite even asking wasnt position ended telling didnt want make lose confidence assumed would get better ended making reliant everything putting nearly half year talked manager performance end work responsibilities entire time confused manager ended talk telling option hire whoever applied applied position lower one manager practically gave position also ended saying im genuinely one best employees adding even confusion fast forward months every new employee either asks treats thinks im higher position nothing changes later assistant manager comes ask interested position another need said told manager said want show ownership felt like utter slap face year ago asked explicitly said would like position acknowledged seemed like proceeding totally brushing present time went told manager would open taking position following weeks learn another worker started way getting promoted instead worker even asked im getting promotion also supporter work told manager really didnt want position utterly confused world going feel like im bizarro land thoughts im lost,"{'neg': 0.11, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.7279}",0.7279
so anxious that I failed at quitting my job,"EDIT: I did it, thank you all for the advice.

\-

Hopefully this doesn't come off as too vent-y, I'm just genuinely at a loss.

For context: I'm young, and this is my first job. One coworker was sexually harassing me from day 1 and I'm just not having it. I have a different job lined up the second I get out of this one so it's not a huge deal to quit. I just have super bad social anxiety and am pressured easily.

Now, I already technically reported this issue, and heard nothing back. Then they scheduled me again with the guy they knew was not safe for me to be around. Everyone I've told about him has told me to quit this job, and I want to. I hyped myself up to do it, went into the office to tell them, and it became a whole situation.

I just wanted to notify them that I'm quitting effective Now, and that it's because a coworker was being sexually innapropriate. The plan was ""hey I'm quitting and here's why, just as a heads up in case you didn't know he's Like That"". My manager made it a huge deal, I assume because liability, and kinda pressured me into staying to make a whole report, which, fine. I get it. But then I got pressured into actually staying? I didn't get to even quit??? I don't even really know how that happened, I got so freaked out by reporting it that it took all my energy and I couldn't stand my ground on quitting.

I'm aware how absolutely ridiculous this is. I basically got peer-pressured into staying at this job. It's bad enough I'm considering lying to them, anything that'll get me out of it. Like, ""oh, my sick grandpa needs a full-time caregiver"" or something. I know that's not the right thing to do but I was barely able to get through the HR report, I do NOT want to stick around for when people realize I reported him because he is unfortunately well-liked.

It's my first job, first time being sexually harassed like this, first time having to make a very scary and intimidating HR report (where I felt like I wasn't even taken seriously), and my first time trying to quit a job - and I just don't really know what to do. I guess I'm looking for advice.

My boss is completely unclear and scattered,"So I started an assistant job helping an agent with her business. She explained to me she was very cluttered and all over the place, but boy I am surprised at how she operates. She gave me an understanding of the work that she planned to have me do. Cool great. But as I started she sort of threw me in it and didn’t give me any instruction whatsoever. For example she told me she wanted me update her website for her but she never gave me any of the login info for her site so I could update it. And then when I asked her for the info she sent me a login but didn’t tell me what platform she uses so it’s like what am I supposed to do with this login? Another example is she wants me to send NDAs to her clients. Okay so where are the NDAs? And mind you this is after she told me “yes you’re hired just get started!😊” like okay get started with what?😭She did tell me that she was like this but I’m just shocked that she’s a successful business woman and she’s this all over the place. I’m trying to figure out how to work with her. I’m excited to do this work though. It’s kinda satisfying to assist and get things done for people. But it’s just odd to me she wants me to work without literally any direction lol. And when I ask she’s like yeah I want this and that, and I’m like uh okay well I’m going to need multiple things ma’am.

How to know if it's time to leave,"So to give back story, this is about an animal sanctuary. I worked there for 6 years and 6 months ago I got a rather shocking evaluation from my bosses. I was the only full time employee working with these animals, and from their words 'they couldn't do any of this without me.' I went on vacation (my second one of the 6 years) and when I was 2 days from coming back my male boss asked if I could get on a call to discuss the food prep situation. I tried to establish a boundary, saying that if it was urgent I could get on a call, but would prefer for it to wait till I came in on Monday and could even come a bit early to make time for a meeting. My boss said that it was urgent and so I agreed to get on the call, not a big deal. Or so I thought. My female boss (they're married) obviously took this the wrong way, but didn't say anything in the moment. A week goes by, they are gone for most of that time on a business trip in which I stayed overnight to watch the animals, and on the following Monday I get called into a meeting. I'm given this horrible evaluation, detailing that I was showing a lack of care, because I didn't get on the call right away it was a display of disrespect to my bosses and position. They called out 2 mistakes I had made the week I came back, not life threatening by any means, and that it showed I essentially didn't want to be there and I had apathy towards the job. I was shocked by this and my options were to: continue in the job and meet their expecting (essentially make no mistakes), quit and be a volunteer again, or quit and come back as a guest once in a while. I had been burnout for a very long time, and yes had been thinking if I wanted to be in that career for my life. I hadn't expected to make the decision to leave so soon, but I took the option to quit and volunteer again. I have created really tight bonds to these animals and didn't want to leave them, but I couldn't be in that position anymore. They were taken back, probably didn't think I'd actually quit. The rest of the week they were telling the narrative of 'oh she just wanted to explore other paths.' Fast forward to a few months later, I came back as a volunteer.

Things are fine, I'm not being given any hard times but sometimes things are awkward. I've always had a very bumpy relationship to my female boss and we've had a lot of arguments and misunderstandings. The environment is ""family style"" so a lot of boundaries get crossed. Recently I see that the two part timers they hired to try taking my place (one a long term volunteer, the other from the outside) are getting sh*t now too. A lot of passive agressive things going on and just overall sh*tty behavior. The work ethic is essentially keep working and stay overtime or you're not dedicated enough. People stay for the animals and each other essentially. It's like once you're there for a while you just can't thinking of leaving. Things are also slowly falling apart now that I've left my position as I was literally holding everything together to keep things running smoothly.

This is the hard part. Because of what happened to me, along with many other incidents over the years that I don't have the time to detail here, I sometimes wonder if I should've even come back. I love working with the animals and still can't imagine not working with them or seeing them on a regular basis. They mean a lot to me and I don't want to see them get neglected. If I left, more than likely a lot of the volunteers would too since they know what actually happened to my position. I guess I'm just trying to see what others would do in this situation. It's a toxic environment when it comes to the bosses, but the animals and volunteer base are so tight and strong.

"SQA Engineer (Payments Domain, 3 YOE) from India Need a Realistic Roadmap to Land a Job Abroad (Family Financial Urgency)","I’m an SQA Engineer with \~3 years of experience in the payments/financial domain (SWIFT MT/MX, ISO 20022, payment flows, manual testing with some automation exposure). I’m currently working in India.

Recently, I lost my father, and my mother is now a single parent. I’m the only earning member, and due to our financial situation, I urgently need to move into a higher-paying role, ideally abroad.

I’m not looking for shortcuts or unrealistic dreams — I want a clear, honest roadmap from people who have actually done this.

Here’s my current profile:

	•	Role: Senior/Associate SQA / QA Engineer

	•	Experience: \~3 years

	•	Domain: Payments, Banking, Financial Markets

	•	Skills: Manual Testing, SQL, basic automation (Python), SWIFT MT/MX, ISO 20022

	•	Location: India

	•	Goal: Job abroad with visa sponsorship or relocation, stable income to support family

I’d really appreciate advice on:

	1.	Which countries are most realistic right now for QA engineers from India?

(EU, UK, Ireland, Singapore, Middle East, Canada, Australia, etc.)

	2.	Is payments domain experience valuable enough internationally, or should I pivot?

	3.	Should I strengthen automation (Selenium / Playwright / API / CI-CD), or focus on domain + manual + SQL?

	4.	Is it better to:

	•	Apply directly to foreign companies?

	•	Join an MNC in India and move internally?

	•	Go via onsite/contract roles?

	5.	Any mistakes to avoid when applying from India?

	6.	Realistically, how long might this take if I execute properly?

I’m not trying to escape work or responsibility — I just need to step up financially for my family during a very difficult time.

If you’ve been in a similar situation, or if you’re working abroad in QA / FinTech / Payments, your guidance would mean a lot.

Boss said someone quit because of me,"I'm 18 and I currently work at walmart. I recently made a mistake with an online order where I gave  a laptop to the wrong order when they got mixed up. About a week later I got called in the office and they told me that I'll be receiving a coaching for that mistake. A coaching is basically three strikes you're out and that would be my second. While my lead was telling me this he also brings up the fact that people are claiming that im not doing my work and I often start slacking off when their isn't a lead around. I told him that I don't understand that at all and I asked to see the camera footage of me doing this. He replied that he doesn't have specific dates. He then hit me with a bombshell and said that people are actually quitting because of me and some have already quit because of me. He said some people dread of coming in when they see me on the schedule and that they feel it's gonna be a bad day when they see me. He also said that people basically have threatened to leave if I don't do better. I asked for names because their have been some petty situations in the past but nothing too major. He then said some of things you gotta start doing is communicating with the team which I pretty much already do. He also mentioned that I just move too slow, which I kinda understand that.

Burnout has risen again in 2025—and it’s not because people are working longer hours,"I’ve been digging into new workplace data and something interesting (and worrying) is showing up again in 2025.

Burnout among U.S. workers is rising after a brief post-pandemic dip—but not for the reason most people assume.

In a lot of cases, people are actually logging *fewer* official hours than a few years ago. The problem is that work has become constant instead of contained.

Across multiple surveys and interviews, the same patterns keep coming up:

* People feel “always on” even when they’re technically off the clock
* Digital tools have pushed work into nights, weekends, and vacations
* Productivity hasn’t improved despite higher availability
* Burnout is increasingly tied to lack of control and unclear expectations, not raw workload

What struck me most is how much of the last two years focused on *where* people work (remote vs. office), while far less attention went to *how* work is structured—communication norms, recovery time, and what actually counts as “enough.”

I wrote up a breakdown of what the data is showing, why burnout is worsening again in 2025 and beyond, and what some companies are starting to experiment with (meeting-free days, output-based reviews, shorter workweeks).

Curious if this matches what others are seeing at work.

"[Mech. Engineering] Leaving cushy job I hate for risky, long-commute job for career growth?","Trying to determine whether I should hop jobs, I know it’s really dependent on personal circumstances but I’d like some opinions here. I’m a mechanical engineer w/ 2.5 YOE. 

Current job / New job:
-Salary: 100K / 110K
-PTO: 17 days / 20 days
-Floating holidays: 10 days / 11 days
-WFH: 1-2 days with flexibility for more if needed / 1 day firm
-Commute: 15 min / 1 hr
-401k match: 6% / 5%
-Yearly company HSA contribution: 600 / 1750
-Bonus: None / merit or percentage, also has 2500 signing bonus and 1500 moving assistance
-Yearly raises: 2-3% / 3+%
-Job security: Very secure / Risky
-Area COL: M-HCOL / VHCOL (but no rent)

My current job is as a mechanical systems engineer in a big corporate firm in the defense industry. It's very bureaucratic, all I do is read reports and make powerpoints, and I am basically a paperwork engineer. I made the mistake of accepting a side-role for 'exposure to management' and have since become a  secretary with 'engineer' in my title. 

My personal growth and career progression is 100% stagnating. My morale is in the dumps, I hate my work and can barely make myself get up in the morning every day, and I'm even falling behind now because I hate everything I do so much. The only silver lining is that work-life balance and the people are great. 

The new job is a strictly analysis role and is far more in line with what I want to do. It's close(ish) to my parents' house, so I'd be able to commute from there and save a ton of money. But it's a startup-y company and has signs of common startup issues (extreme growth, disorganization, layoffs from overhiring/reorganization) and seems to be rather volatile. I wouldn't be surprised if I got laid off in a year or two. Also that commute is nasty. 

My current job is extremely stable. With the current rough job market, if I leave now it seems like I'd be leaving a unicorn job (safe, good pay, flexible WFH, great work-life balance, great team environment) for a very risky and potentially stressful job that might not even be greener on the other side, and eventually end up laid off and scrambling for a job in a terrible market. 

But right now I'm stuck career-wise and utterly miserable with what I do... I see no future in my current role. At least in the new job I'd get to go back to being an engineer. And if I do get laid off I'd have at least learned something more relevant to my industry and be able to leverage it for my next job.

Considering all this, y'all think jumping ship would be worth it?

Is it really that hard to just say no?,"Last week, I reached the reference check stage of a hiring process and was asked to provide two references. Because I had previously raised concerns about my manager at my last company, I didn’t feel comfortable asking them. Instead, I reached out to someone else I had worked with, and they completely ignored me.

I worked through an HR agency at both my previous company and the one before that. So I contacted the agency representative I had been in regular contact with during my assignment. They have since moved to another company, but I reached out politely on LinkedIn to ask if they’d be comfortable being a reference. They read my message but never responded.

I keep thinking: is it really that hard to just say you’re not able to help? Even if I didn’t like someone, I would still respond in a situation like this and if I couldn’t help, I’d at least say so.

I have no idea what I am doing wrong...please let me know,"I graduated in April with degrees in Finance and Economics (GPA 3.76). During college I worked as a bank teller, completed a Finance & Audit internship (SOX/SOC controls), then spent over a year as a Finance Co-op in Regulatory Affairs & Compliance at a Michigan utility company.

I supported electric rate case filings, responded to regulatory audit and discovery requests, worked with financial documentation used in testimony, and used tools like Excel, NetSuite, Oracle, Salesforce, and Power Automate. I was strong enough in that role that, despite the department not hiring entry-level, my manager brought me back as a Finance & Regulatory Compliance Contractor after graduation.

Despite this background, I ended up taking a job as an ACH Operations Specialist at a bank. I’m grateful to be employed, but I genuinely hate the work. It’s high-volume operations, not analytical, and it’s draining my confidence. I’m the only person on my team (besides my boss) with a degree, and I’m making  $23/hour.

I’ve been actively applying for months company sites, LinkedIn, referrals, recruiter outreach and I keep hitting walls. I can’t relocate due to family caregiving responsibilities, so my market is limited, which makes this harder.

I don’t want to stay in banking operations, retail banking, or clerical roles. I want to move into analysis, compliance, regulatory, audit, policy, or economics-adjacent work something where judgment and thinking matter.

Right now I feel like my confidence is slipping and I’m worried I’m losing momentum early in my career.

**My question:**

  
For people who started in finance/econ and felt stuck in ops or misaligned roles early on what *actually* helped you pivot out? Are there specific roles, industries, or strategies I might be missing, especially in smaller job markets?
